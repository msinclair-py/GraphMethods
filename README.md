# GraphMethods
Collection of graph theory algorithms for various graph-based analysis and construction methodologies

ConSubG
  An efficient algorithm for finding all connected subgraphs of size k from a given graph. Algorithm developed by Shant Karakashian et. al at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the Constraint Systems Lab: https://consystlab.unl.edu/our_work/software.html. Originally written in C++, I have re-implemented the algorithm in python for ease of use in other python-based projects.
